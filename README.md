This is a link to the trailer for a game created during one of my university classes.

Unfortunately due to this being a school project i cannot publicly show the code for this project but the link below will give an example of what me and my partner had created.

This project was a semester long project using entity relationship framework to design the code structure.

All textures were created by us for this game. This project was designed with having a team of 4 in mind. Our team had only two and while this had us at a disadantage we created the best project we could in the short period of time. Some aspects that were meant to be completed had to be forgone for us to finish the project on time. Thankfully i believe we performed to the best of our ability under the contraints that we had.
